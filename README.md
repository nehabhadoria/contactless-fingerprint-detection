## Project Overview

In recent years, the importance of personal data protection has grown significantly. Fingerprint biometrics, being both unique and permanent, have become the cornerstone of identity verification systems. They are extensively utilized by forensic departments in criminal investigations and by governmental and private institutions for personal identification and verification purposes.

The traditional approach to fingerprint matching, based on minutiae, has been widely employed for decades. However, with advancements in technology, deep learning-based models have emerged as powerful tools for pattern recognition tasks. In this project, we leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a deep learning classification model for fingerprint identification.

Our project focuses on classifying fingerprints using a dataset comprising fingerprints from 336 individuals. We employ computer vision pre-processing techniques to extract regions of interest from fingerprint images, facilitating effective feature extraction. Through experimentation, we identify the optimal CNN architecture that achieves superior recognition performance, offering a rapid and accurate fingerprint classification solution.
